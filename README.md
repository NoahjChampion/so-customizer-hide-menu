Hides the Navigation Menu from the Customizer so as not to confuse anyone.

## Description

Whilst many people have opposed the decision, the navigation menu interface was forced into the Customizer.

As there are many people who don't have to time to explain this to all existing clients, this plugin simply hides the menu panel/section from the Customizer.
